Install PyInstaller: Open your terminal and 
install PyInstaller using pip:
* pip install pyinstaller * 

Navigate to your script’s directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory 
that contains your Python script.
eX -:  cd 'E:\My Software Projects\Password_Generation_Python\pythonProject'


Run PyInstaller: Now you can create the executable. If your script is named taskbar_icon.py 
and your icon is named icon2.ico, you would run:
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon2.ico taskbar_icon.py
Here’s what the options mean:
--onefile: Create a one-file bundled executable.
--windowed: Do not provide a console window for standard i/o. Use this option if your application has a GUI.
--icon=icon2.ico: Use icon2.ico as the icon for the executable.
Find your executable: After running this command, you’ll find the executable in the dist folder 
inside your current directory.

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon2.ico main.py

To build the executable, you would run python setup.py build in your terminal. 
This will create a build directory with the executable inside.

python setup.py build

The command prompt window is appearing because your Python application is a console application. When you run a console application, it’s normal for the command prompt to appear, as it’s used for standard input and output.

If you don’t want the command prompt to appear, you can convert your Python script into a Windows GUI application. When you do this, no console window is created when the application is run.

If you’re using PyInstaller to create the executable, you can use the --noconsole or --windowed option to suppress the console window:

pyinstaller --windowed --icon=app_icon.ico main.py

This will create an executable that runs as a Windows GUI application. The application will function the same way, but no console window will be created when it’s run.

Yes, you can suppress the console window when using cx_Freeze to build your application. You need to pass base="Win32GUI" in the Executable function in your setup.py script. Here’s how you can modify your setup.py script:

Python

from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable

base = None
if sys.platform == "win32":
    base = "Win32GUI"

setup(
    name="Password Generator",
    version="1.0",
    description="Simple Python application for generating the password",
    executables=[Executable("main.py", base=base, icon="app_icon.ico")],
    options={
        "build_exe": {
            "packages": ["secrets", "string", "tkinter", "tkinter.ttk"],
            "include_files": ["requirements.txt", "app_icon.ico"]
        }
    }
)

This will create an executable that runs as a Windows GUI application. The application will function the same way, but no console window will be created when it’s run.

Please replace 'app_icon.ico' and 'main.py' with the path to your icon file and your Python script, respectively.
